PHASES COMPLETED
[Completed] Phase 1: Professional project structure & clean code separation
[Completed] Phase 2: Desktop MVP with side-by-side coach + user view
[Completed] Phase 3: Accurate symmetric arm angle detection (elbow + shoulder)
[Completed] Phase 4: Real-time feedback system ("CORRECT!", color coding)
[Completed] Phase 5: Skeleton overlay + smooth UI experience
[Completed] Phase 6: Config-driven settings (tolerance, video path, resolution)
[Completed] Phase 7: Full documentation (README, TODO, setup guide)
[Completed] Phase 8: Converted to FastAPI + WebSocket backend
     → Real-time webcam streaming from browser
     → Dynamic reference video selection
     → Sends back coach frame + user frame with skeleton + live feedback
     → Zero-lag experience, ready for MERN stack integration


CURRENT STATUS
